# EmbeddedAndRTOSSamples
Code samples for Embedded and Real-Time Operating Systems by K. C. Wang.

1st edition: <https://www.amazon.com/Embedded-Real-Time-Operating-Systems-K-C/dp/3319515160/ref=sr_1_3?qid=1567302873&refinements=p_27%3AK.C.+Wang&s=books&sr=1-3&text=K.C.+Wang>.

The book says the sample code can be found at <http://www.eecs.wsu.edu/~cs460/ARMhome>.

But it seems not longer available.

I practice the sample code and put them here together with detailed steps and notes.

And perhaps more samples of my own.

Hope others can benefit from this.
